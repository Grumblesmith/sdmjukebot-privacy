<body><h1>Societe de Moutarde User Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Effective Date: February 6, 2019</p>

<p>Societe de Moutarde (“Societe de Moutarde,” “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the “Service”), and websites, including but not limited to https://sdmoutarde.com, (the “Websites”).</p>

<p>Societe de Moutarde has three different types of users depending on the Societe de Moutarde products used:</p>

<p>We call users of the Websites “Site Visitors.”</p>
<p>We call users who use the free version of the Societe de Moutarde Service “Free Users.” While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.</p>
<p>We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Societe de Moutarde subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) “Subscribers.” The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Societe de Moutarde and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “Customer Agreement”).</p>
<p>We refer to these three types of users collectively as “Users” or “you” for purposes of these User Terms of Service (the “Terms”). Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and Societe de Moutarde and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites. By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites.</p>

<p>We may, from time to time, modify these Terms. Please check this page periodically for updates. If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and Websites. The updated Terms will take effect upon their posting and will apply on a going-forward basis, unless otherwise provided in a notice to you, and except as provided in the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section of these Terms. Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

We reserve the right to remove any Feedback posted in public forums for any reason at our sole discretion.</p>

<p>3.3 User Content and Feedback Representations.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that you have all required rights to submit User Content and Feedback without violation of any third-party rights. You understand that Societe de Moutarde does not control, and is not responsible for, User Content or Feedback, and that by using the Service and/or Websites, you may be exposed to User Content or Feedback from other users that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Please also note that User Content and Feedback may contain typographical errors, other inadvertent errors or inaccuracies. You agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Societe de Moutarde for all claims resulting from User Content or Feedback you submit through the Service and/or Websites.

<p>6. WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
<p>THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES AND USER CONTENT, WHETHER PROVIDED BY Societe de Moutarde, ITS LICENSORS, ITS VENDORS OR ITS USERS, AND OTHER INFORMATION ON OR ACCESSIBLE FROM THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, OR GUARANTEE OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS OR GUARANTEES OF QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. SPECIFICALLY, BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION, Societe de Moutarde DOES NOT WARRANT THAT: (i) THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES IS FREE OF ERRORS; (ii) THE FUNCTIONS OR FEATURES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MECHANISMS FOR THE DOWNLOADING AND UPLOADING OF USER CONTENT) WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS; (iii) DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR (iv) THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES OR THE SERVER(S) THAT MAKE THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. IN NO EVENT SHALL Societe de Moutarde OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, VENDORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, OR COSTS OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, ANY MATERIALS, INFORMATION, OR RECOMMENDATIONS APPEARING ON THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, OR ANY LINK PROVIDED ON THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, WHETHER OR NOT Societe de Moutarde HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, VIOLATION OF STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE. THIS EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IN ANY EVENT, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SERVICE OR WEBSITES TO WHICH THE CLAIM RELATES OR, IF THE CLAIM DOES NOT RELATE TO A PRODUCT OR SERVICE, $100. Societe de Moutarde DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES OR ANY WEBSITE FEATURED OR LINKED TO THROUGH THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, AND Societe de Moutarde WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICE AND WEBSITES. Societe de Moutarde WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY. YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” This release includes the criminal acts of others.</p>

<p>7. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages such as above in Section 7. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you. If you are a New Jersey resident, or a resident of another state that permits the exclusion of these warranties and liabilities, then the limitations in Section 6 specifically do apply to you.</p>

<p>8. INDEMNITY</p>
<p>YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD Societe de Moutarde AND ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, CONTRACTORS, OR REPRESENTATIVES (AND ALL SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING), HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, YOUR CONNECTION TO THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, YOUR VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OR Societe de Moutarde’S PRIVACY POLICY, YOUR VIOLATION OF AN APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBMISSION, POSTING, OR TRANSMISSION OF USER CONTENT TO THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, AND/OR YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, AT OUR OWN EXPENSE, TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF SUCH DISPUTES, AND IN ANY EVENT YOU WILL COOPERATE WITH US IN ASSERTING ANY AVAILABLE DEFENSES.</p>

<p>9. THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND SERVICE AND WEBSITES</p>
<p>The Service and Websites may provide (1) information and content provided by third parties; (2) links to third-party websites or resources, such as sellers of goods and services; and (3) third-party products and services for sale directly to you. Societe de Moutarde is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for (i) any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources, (ii) any errors or omissions in these websites or resources, or (iii) any information handling practices or other business practices of the operators of such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Societe de Moutarde shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any linked sites or resources. Your interactions with such third parties will be governed by the third parties’ own terms of service and privacy policies, and any other similar terms.</p>

<p>10. MODIFICATION</p>
<p>Societe de Moutarde reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service and Websites (or any part thereof), with or without notice. You agree that Societe de Moutarde shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service and Websites.</p>

<p>11. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>

<p>11.1 Application.</p>
<p>You and Societe de Moutarde agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 12 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>

<p>11.2. Initial Dispute Resolution.</p>
<p>Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at dispute-notice@sdmoutarde.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Societe de Moutarde, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

<p>11.3 Binding Arbitration.</p>
<p>If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided in section 11.7 below) subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of Societe de Moutarde shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (“JAMS”). The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Societe de Moutarde will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Societe de Moutarde will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>

<p>11.4 Arbitrator’s Powers.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>11.5 Filing a Demand.</p>
<p>To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration (“Demand”) that (i) briefly explains the dispute, (ii) lists your and Societe de Moutarde’s names and addresses, (iii) specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable, (iv) identify the requested location for a hearing if an in-person hearing is requested, and (v) state what you want in the dispute; (b) send one copy of the Demand to JAMS, along with a copy of these Terms and the filing fee required by JAMS; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at dispute-notice@sdmoutarde.com.</p>

<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you and Societe de Moutarde agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, United States, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

<p>11.6 Class Action Waiver.</p>
<p>The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND Societe de Moutarde AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

<p>11.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in small claims court in San Francisco, California for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>

<p>11.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to dispute-notice@sdmoutarde.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Service or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on the Site. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Societe de Moutarde also will not be bound by them.</p>

<p>11.9 Changes to This Section.</p>
<p>Societe de Moutarde will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Service and Websites. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Service and Websites or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Service and Websites.</p>

<p>11.10 Survival.</p>
<p>This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Service and Websites.</p>

<p>12. CONTROLLING LAW AND SEVERABILITY</p>
<p>These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of California notwithstanding its conflicts of law principles. Any dispute arising out of these terms and conditions or the use of this site shall be initiated and conducted in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California, and you and Societe de Moutarde consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

<p>13. GENERAL TERMS</p>
<p>13.1 Force Majeure.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances shall Societe de Moutarde or its licensor or supplier be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control.</p>

<p>13.2 No Waiver.</p>
<p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be binding unless in writing, no waiver of any provisions of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and the failure of Societe de Moutarde to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive that right or remedy. If an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>13.3 Third-Party Beneficiaries.</p>
<p>You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>

<p>13.4 Statute of Limitations.</p>
<p>Except for residents of New Jersey, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Service and Websites and/or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>

<p>13.5 Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>These Terms (and all terms and conditions incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Societe de Moutarde and govern your use of the Service and Websites, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Societe de Moutarde on the subject matter. These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by you. These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned or delegated by Societe de Moutarde without restriction. These Terms bind and inure to the benefit of each party and the party’s successors and permitted assigns. These Terms may not be modified by an oral statement by a representative of Societe de Moutarde. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by these Terms. You agree that any agreements made by and between you and us in electronic form are as legally binding as if made in physical written form. If you are using the Service and Websites for or on behalf of the U.S. government, your license rights do not exceed those granted to non-government consumers. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any provision of these Terms that by its nature is reasonably intended to survive beyond termination of these Terms shall survive.</p>

<p>13.6 Notices.</p>
<p>We may deliver notice to you by e-mail, posting a notice on the Service and Websites or any other method we choose and such notice will be effective on dispatch. If you give notice to us, it will be effective when received and you must use the following email address: terms-questions@sdmoutarde.com.</p>

It is possible that you may use Societe de Moutarde in different ways. If so, please review all applicable privacy terms. Also, don’t forget to review Section V, which contains privacy terms applicable to all users.</p>

<p>Subscribers. We call users who use the Service as part of any tier of a paid Societe de Moutarde subscription plan “Subscribers.” The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the specific terms agreed to between Societe de Moutarde and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (for purpose of this Policy, the “Customer Agreement”). The Customer controls its instance of the Service and is the data controller of the information collected through the Service about Subscribers, and Societe de Moutarde is a data processor of such information.</p>
<p>Free Users. We call users who use a non-paid version of the Service “Free Users.” While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers. Societe de Moutarde is the data controller of the information collected through the Service about Free Users.</p>
<p>Site Visitors. We call users of the Websites “Site Visitors.” Site Visitors can be individuals who are simply browsing the Websites but who do not use the Societe de Moutarde Service; or, Site Visitors can be Free Users or Subscribers who visit the Websites to seek additional information about Societe de Moutarde. Societe de Moutarde is the data controller of the information collected through the Website about Site Visitors.</p>
<p>2. Privacy Terms for Subscribers</p>
<p>A. Overview</p>
<p>Section II of this Policy applies only to Subscribers.</p>

<p>If you are a Subscriber, the “Customer Agreement” governs the collection and processing of information collected from you through the Customer’s instance of the Service (e.g. a Customer’s organization or workspace, but for purposes of this Policy referred to as the “Workspace”), including all associated messages, attachments, files, tasks, projects and project names, team names, channels, conversations, and other content submitted through the Service (“Workspace Content”). In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Customer Agreement, the Customer Agreement governs. Because the Customer controls the Workspace used by Subscribers, if you have any questions about the Customer’s specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you are a Subscriber located in the European Union, please note that the Customer is the data controller with respect to the processing of your Workspace Content pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). When processing Workspace Content of EU data subjects governed by the Customer Agreement, Societe de Moutarde is the data processor, meaning that we collect and process such information solely on behalf of the Customer.</p>

<p>B. Collection and Use of Subscriber Information</p>
<p>This section explains the information we collect from Subscribers. We do not require Subscribers to provide us with information. However, certain information, such as account log-in data, is required to provide you with access to the Service, and other information may be collected automatically as you use the Service.</p>

<p>Workspace Content. Workspace Content is collected, used, and shared by Societe de Moutarde in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, or as required by applicable law. The Customer, and not Societe de Moutarde, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Workspace Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Customer may provide or remove access to the Service, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, or share projects. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings that they have instituted with respect the Workspace Content that you provide when using the Service.</p>
<p>Account Information. To set up your Societe de Moutarde account, you or the Customer will provide us with basic information about you which may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, and password. You will then have the ability to provide optional profile information, such as a photograph or basic demographic data. With your permission, we may also upload calendar information stored on your mobile device to your account. If you submit payment information in connection with your use of the Service, we utilize a third party credit card payment processing company to collect payment information, including your credit card number, billing address, and phone number. In such circumstances, the third party service provider, and not Societe de Moutarde, stores your payment information on our behalf.</p>
<p>Service Usage Information. As you use the Service, we collect information about how you use and interact with the Service (“Service Usage Information”). Such information includes:</p>
<p>Device information – when you access the Service using a mobile device, we collect certain device information, including the type of device you are using, its operating system, and mobile network information, which may include your mobile phone number. We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.</p>
<p>Log files – when you use the Service, our servers automatically record information in server log files. These log files may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, date and time stamp information, language preferences, data from cookies and similar technologies, and other such information.</p>
<p>Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</p>
<p>Workspace Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Workspace. For example, we may log the number of Workspaces you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; the types of files you share; and what, if any, third party services and integrations you use.</p>
<p>Other Information. You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); information you provide in connection with Societe de Moutarde sweepstakes, contests, or research studies in which you choose to participate; beta testing; and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).</p>
<p>Information Collected from Third-Party Integrations. If you choose to use or connect to third-party integrations (e.g., OneDrive, Unito, Wufoo, Slack) through the Service, or if you are required or permitted to do so by a Customer, such third parties may allow us to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those services as it relates to your use of the Service. If you initiate these connections, you also understand that we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Service. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections. By enabling these connections, you authorize us to connect and access the information provided through these connections, and you understand that the privacy policies of these third parties govern such connections.</p>

<p>Online Advertising The Websites may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Websites, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Websites, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above.

<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Websites by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Websites, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>

<p>Notice Concerning Do Not Track Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.

<p>10 Use Outside the United States of America.</p>
<p>The Service is controlled and operated by Societe de Moutarde from its offices in the United States of America. Except as explicitly set forth herein, Societe de Moutarde makes no representations that the Services are appropriate for use in other jurisdictions. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws. Societe de Moutarde may offer services in other jurisdictions that are subject to different terms and conditions. In such instances, the terms and conditions governing those non-U.S. services shall take precedence over any conflicting provisions in this Agreement.</p>

<p>11 Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>11.1 Prior Versions. If you were an existing Customer prior to February 6, 2019, the prior version of this Agreement you agreed to when subscribing to the Service will continue to apply to you until you are otherwise notified in accordance with the terms of that agreement.</p>

<p>11.2 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement and any disputes arising under it will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and each party consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>

<p>11.3 Informal Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. The parties agree that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation with each other before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If, after good faith negotiations the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, including without limitation its existence, validity or termination, shall be resolved according to California law and exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) and pursuant to the then existing arbitration rules at JAMS. If the parties cannot agree upon selection of an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator experienced in the enterprise software industry. The place of the arbitration will be San Francisco, California unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator shall provide detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of any award. Judgment upon any such award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of Section 11.3 mandating arbitration shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. Customer may opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending written notice to Societe de Moutarde. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement between Customer and Societe de Moutarde. If Customer opts out of arbitration, Societe de Moutarde also will not be bound to arbitrate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief as set forth in Section 5.3 (“Equitable Relief”) above and to stop unauthorized use of the Service or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. Disputes, claims, or controversies concerning either party’s Intellectual Property Rights or claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service shall not be subject to arbitration. The parties further agree that the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce any right or provisions under this Agreement, including any arbitration or court proceedings, will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

<p>11.4 Notice. Societe de Moutarde may give general notices related to the Service that are applicable to all customers by email, text, in-app notifications, or by posting them on the Societe de Moutarde website or through the Service and such electronic notices shall be deemed to satisfy any legal requirement that such notices be made in writing. Other notices must be sent via email, first class, airmail, or overnight courier to the addresses of the parties provided herein or via an Order Form and are deemed given when received. Notices to Societe de Moutarde must be sent to Societe de Moutarde Legal at legal@sdmoutarde.com</p>

<p>11.5 Publicity. Societe de Moutarde may include Customer’s name and logo in Societe de Moutarde’s online customer list and in print and electronic marketing materials.</p>

<p>11.6 Beta Access. Customer may be invited to participate in review and testing of pre-release versions of new and beneficial tools and Service enhancements which may be identified to Customer as “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” “pre-release,” “early access,” or “evaluation” product or services (collectively, the “Beta Tests” and such pre-release functionality, the “Beta Product”). Customer acknowledges and understands that its participation in Beta Tests is not required and is at Customer’s own risk, and that Beta Products are made available on an “as is” basis without warranties (express or implied) of any kind, and may be discontinued or modified at any time. Beta Products are for evaluation and testing purposes, not for production use, not supported, not subject to availability or security obligations, and may be subject to additional terms. Societe de Moutarde shall have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with Beta Products. The Beta Products, including without limitation Customer’s assessment of any Beta Product, are Confidential Information of Societe de Moutarde.</p>

<p>11.7 Relationship of the Parties. The parties are and shall be independent contractors with respect to all services provided under this Agreement. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Without limiting this Section, a Customer’s End Users are not third-party beneficiaries to Customer’s rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p>11.8 Force Majeure. Societe de Moutarde shall not be liable for delayed or inadequate performance of its obligations hereunder to the extent caused by a condition that is beyond Societe de Moutarde’s reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disaster, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or war, labor conditions, governmental actions, interruption or failure of the Internet or any utility service, failures in third-party hosting services, and denial of service attacks (each a “Force Majeure Event”). Societe de Moutarde shall be relieved from its obligations (or part thereof) as long as the Force Majeure Event lasts and hinders the performance of said obligations (or part thereof). Societe de Moutarde shall promptly notify Customer and make reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event.</p>

<p>11.9 Severability; No Waiver. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to any judicial decree or decision, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and remain enforceable between the parties. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a party’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>11.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and licenses granted under this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by either party without the other party’s express written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that either party may assign this Agreement and all Order Forms under this Agreement upon written notice without the other party’s consent to an Affiliate or to its successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the non-assigning party. Any other attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors, and permitted assigns.</p>

<p>11.11 U.S. Government Agencies. If Customer is a U.S. Government agency utilizing Societe de Moutarde’s Service in an official capacity, Customer’s use of the Service shall be subject to this Subscriber Agreement and the Amendment to Societe de Moutarde Subscriber Agreement Applicable to U.S. Government Customers.</p>

<p>11.12 Modifications. Societe de Moutarde may revise this Agreement from time to time by posting the modified version on its website. If, in Societe de Moutarde’s sole discretion, the modifications proposed are material, Societe de Moutarde shall provide Customer with notice in accordance with Section 11.4 at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of the modifications being made. By continuing to access or use the Service after the posted effective date of modifications to this Agreement, Customer agrees to be bound by the revised version of the Agreement.</p>

<p>11.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all attachments, exhibits, addendums, and any Order Form(s) hereunder, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to its subject matter. The parties are not relying and have not relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this agreement, express or implied, except for the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of the Agreement and any Order Form, the Agreement shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, no terms or conditions stated in a Customer purchase order, vendor onboarding process, web portal, or any other Customer order documentation shall be incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions shall be null and void.</p>

<p>Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines</p>
<p>These guidelines are intended to provide law enforcement authorities with information regarding the process for requesting records from Societe de Moutarde. So that we can ensure compliance with our user Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we respond only to law enforcement requests that adhere to established legal process and applicable law.</p>

<p>U.S. Legal Process Requirements. We disclose user information solely in accordance with our published Terms of Service and applicable U.S. law, including the federal Stored Communications Act (“SCA”), 18 U.S.C. Sections 2701-2712. In accordance with U.S. law:</p>

<p>A jurisdictionally valid subpoena, issued in connection with an official criminal investigation, is required to compel the disclosure of basic user records, which may include name, length of service, credit card information (including billing address), email address(es), and an IP address, if available.</p>
<p>A court order is required to compel the disclosure of certain records or other information related to a user account (not including contents of communications), which may include message headers and IP addresses, in addition to the basic user records identified above.</p>
<p>A search warrant properly issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, based on a showing of probable cause, is required to compel the disclosure of the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, attachments, or other content of communications within a user’s account.</p>
<p>International Legal Requirements. In the case of requests from law enforcement outside of the U.S., a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request or letter rogatory may be required to compel the disclosure of the contents of an account.</p>

Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain a proper court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited. Please note that Officer authored affidavits, cover letters or similar statements are not sufficient to preclude notice to our users. Please note that in situations where a data request draws attention to an ongoing violation of our Terms of Service we may, in order to protect our service and its Users, take action to prevent any further abuse, including actions that could notify the User(s) who are the subject of your data request that we are aware of their misconduct.</p>

<p>Societe de Moutarde's Commitment to GDPR Compliance</p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a European law establishing protections for the personal data of EU residents that came into force on May 25, 2018. Under the GDPR, organizations that collect, maintain, use, or otherwise process EU residents’ personal data (regardless of the organization’s location) must implement certain privacy and security safeguards for that data. Societe de Moutarde has established a comprehensive GDPR compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on GDPR compliance efforts. Some significant steps Societe de Moutarde has taken to align its practices with the GDPR include:</p>

<p>Revisions to our policies and contracts with our partners, vendors, and users</p>
<p>Enhancements to our security practices and procedures</p>
<p>Closely reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share</p>
<p>Creating more robust internal privacy and security documentation</p>
<p>Training employees on GDPR requirements and privacy/security best practices generally</p>
<p>Carefully evaluating and building a data subject rights’ policy and response process Below, we provide additional details about the core areas of Societe de Moutarde’s GDPR compliance program and how customers can use Societe de Moutarde to support their own GDPR compliance initiatives.</p>
<p>Data Processing Agreements</p>
<p>Under the GDPR, “data controllers” (i.e. entities that determine the purposes and means of processing data) are required to enter into agreements with other entities that process data on their behalf (called “data processors”). Societe de Moutarde offers its customers who are controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into a robust data processing agreement under which Societe de Moutarde commits to process and safeguard personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements. This includes Societe de Moutarde’s commitment to process personal data consistent with the instructions of the data controller.</p>

<p>International Data Transfers</p>
<p>As with prior EU data protection laws, the GDPR requires organizations to use a recognized legal mechanism to transfer data from the EU to other countries that do not have a similar data protection framework, including the United States. To comply with this requirement, Societe de Moutarde is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, which requires it to maintain certain safeguards for personal data transferred to the United States. Additionally, Societe de Moutarde offers customers who are data controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into EU Model Contractual Clauses with us upon request.</p>

<p>Data Access, Management, and Portability Tools</p>
<p>The GDPR gives individual data subjects in certain circumstances the rights to, among other things, access, delete, and make corrections to their data. Societe de Moutarde is committed to facilitating data subject requests consistent with the GDPR, as further described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Privacy Documentation</p>
<p>At its core, the GDPR is focused on transparency, fairness, and accountability. Accordingly, the law requires organizations to maintain documentation about their privacy practices and their decisions about how they handle individuals’ personal data. Societe de Moutarde shares the GDPR’s commitment to these principles, and has included within its ongoing GDPR compliance program documentation about its data collection and processing activities, and the various policies and guidelines it follows pursuant to the GDPR. You can learn more about how Societe de Moutarde collects, uses, and discloses personal data by visiting Societe de Moutarde’s Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Data Security</p>
<p>The GDPR requires organizations to use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal data. Security continues to be a priority for Societe de Moutarde: we are now SOC 2 Type 1 certified (read more about our certification here) and have implemented a variety of safeguards to protect the security of our platform, including encrypting web connections to protect data transmissions, replicating our databases to support reliability of the platform, and controlling access to our facilities and office network. Societe de Moutarde also offers customers the ability to use additional security controls to further enhance the security of their teams’ data. For more information, please see our Security Statement.</p>

<p>Ongoing Compliance and Communication</p>
<p>The GDPR’s requirements are comprehensive, but the law and regulatory guidance will evolve. As data protection authorities in Europe interpret the GDPR’s requirements and issue guidance, we will continue to follow these developments closely and evaluate our program for any changes or enhancements as needed. We value communication with our customers. If you have any questions about our GDPR compliance efforts, or if you are a data controller customer with questions about how we can help support your own GDPR compliance efforts, please contact us at privacy@sdmoutarde.com.</p>
